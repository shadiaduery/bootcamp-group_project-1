Business Questions:
Do rates of Covid19 differ based on state policies implemented?

Hypothesis:
Stronger policies reduce the rated of Covid19 spread.



Datasources:

- John Hopkings University Covid19 data
- County information and landsize for population density calculations
- NY Times
- USA.gov land survey

Project Outline:

- Timeframe: January - October
- We will compare data by county from two States that we know applied different Covid19 lockdown policies: CA and TX
- Rate of infection (covid cases per day)
- Total number of covid19 cases per State per month
- Heat map of COVID cases per county (per state)
- Scatter plots that compare COVID per capita and population density by county (by state)

Data Analysis / Visualizations:

- Total number of confirmed Covid cases per state for timeline (Jan-Oct) 
- Number of new dauly confirmed Covid cases by state for timeime (Jan-Oct)
- Exploratory Data Analyis: Population vs. Total Number of Covid cases by state for multiple time stamps for timeline (x4)
- Heat Map of total confirmed cases at 2 week infection increments
- Scatter plot to show log relationships for Total Cases for CA & TX vs. Time
- Line graph of New Daily Cases for CA & TX vs. Time
- Scatter plot for CA - Population Density vs. COVID Cases per Capita w/ linear regression 
- Saatter plot for TX - Population Density vs. COVID Cases per Capita w/ linear regression

Tools:

- jupyter notebook
- csv file
- libraries

Limitations:
- Policy implementation and execution: within a state with the same Covid guidelines, we cannot tell if the policies were implemented in each county. 
- Testing: these studies were based on confirmed cases, therefore people who were infected with Covid, but did not show symptoms were probably not counted (the actual count could be so much higher).

Things that we would do differently next time:
- Include more states in comparison
- Compare to other country policies
